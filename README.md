REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROJECT'S IMPLEMENTATION

Based on the domain entities, create classes that describe them.
Classes and methods should have names that reflect their functionality.
Use collection classes to store lists or sets of classes.
Use the capabilities of OOP: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
Each class should have a meaningful name and informative composition.
Inheritance should be used only when it makes sense.
When coding, you should use the java code convention.
Classes should be organized into packages.
Use files to store initialization parameters (if there is no requirement for console input).
Provide proper handling of user errors.
Creating custom exception classes is encouraged.

CREATE AN INFORMATION SYSTEM

The Aeroflot system. The Administrator forms a flight crew (pilots, navigator, radio operator, and flight attendants) for each flight. Each flight is operated by an aircraft with a specific capacity and flight range. The flight may be canceled by the Dispatcher due to weather conditions, destination, or technical issues.
